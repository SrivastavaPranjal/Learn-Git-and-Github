# Learn-Git-and-Github
Learn all the basic and advanced commands related to Git. Git is the most commonly used Distributed Version Control System.
Git tracks all the the modification you make to files or projects, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can rollback to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes easier to collaborate, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.
